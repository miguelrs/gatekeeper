Gatekeeper (Request JS)
=======================

This is a copy of the original project [prose/gatekeeper](https://github.com/prose/gatekeeper), but this one is using 
the library [request/request](https://github.com/request/request) to make the OAuth requests.  

For some reason the original code does not work _for me_, and this one does;
but probably **you should use the original project**.
